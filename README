How to compile the project:
Type 'make'

Example of how to run the project:
./oss -n 3 -s 2 -t 4 -i 0.6 -f log.txt

Notes: 
I have the increment amount for every loop set to 1000000 ns or 1 ms to try to reduce the size of the log file still more than 1000 lines usually

Generative AI used: ChatGPT
Prompts: 
write a function that prints the page table of each process entry in the PCB in a formatted way similar to how the print_process_table function prints the process table

write a function that prints the frame table with a similar format to how print_page_tables works

what is the issue inside the PCB struct where I create the page table I want a vector of 16 ints all starting with a value of -1

Summary:
wrote the function correctly prints the table in a way I liked

wrote the function correctly, same format as the others

I was writing it vector<int> page_table(16, -1); didn't tell me what I was doing wrong. Gave me some other solutions but I decided to use a constructor instead.
